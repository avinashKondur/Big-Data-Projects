This project is to implement a system that generates a subset of graphs using Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) over currently available Wikipedia articles. HITS is a link analysis algorithm designed to find the key pages for specific web communities. HITS is also known as hubs and authorities. 

App.java is the Main class and HITS algorithm is implemented in HITS.java
