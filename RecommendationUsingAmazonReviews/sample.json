Whether it's shredding meat or moving it, it works well either way. The tips of it are very sharp which is both a pro and a con. If you leave it in a kitchen drawer then you could cut yourself. But it's fantastic at shredding pork or anything else you want to shred. The grip is fun and grips well. This could also be used for many other things such as a very sharp knuckle dusters. Overall these are great claws for shredding things or moving them.

This method works, but takes a while.  If I use two knives to do the job faster, it cuts the meat instead of shredding it.  When I received a complimentary set of Ouddy Meat Claws for testing and review, I knew right away that these would work great!  As it turns out, I had roasted a chicken the day before they arrived.  I used these claws to shred the leftover chicken and I'm amazed!  The claws fit really well in my hands, and the claws are sharp and strong enough to make quick work of shredding meat.  Since they pull off small bits and don't cut the meat, I was left with a pile of truly shredded chicken meat.  They hand washed easily, and are small enough to store stacked in a drawer when not in use.  I'm also looking forward to using them to lift chickens and turkeys from the roasting pan, without burning myself or dropping the bird and splashing myself with the hot juices.And in the off-chance that some passing thief smells your BBQ and breaks in, you can go all Wolverine on them with these claws and save your shredded meat!
